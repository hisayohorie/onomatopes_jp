# You don't have to do things with the Mechanize or ScraperWiki libraries.
# You can use whatever gems you want: https://morph.io/documentation/ruby
# All that matters is that your final data is written to an SQLite database
# called "data.sqlite" in the current working directory which has at least a table
# called "data".
